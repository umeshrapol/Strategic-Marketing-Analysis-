# Strategic Marketing Analysis (SQL)

This project focuses on analyzing survey data to uncover insights into consumer preferences, behaviors, and marketing effectiveness in the energy drink industry. 

We explored key demographics, brand perception, preferred ingredients and packaging, purchase behavior, and the impact of various marketing channels. Based on the findings, we provide strategic recommendations to help brands improve product development, regional focus, and campaign performance.


## 1. Demographic Insights
### a. Who prefers energy drink more? (male/female/non-binary?)
<img width="785" height="417" alt="Q1 a" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/561f499d-32f8-4e77-83d8-b370885375d1" />

Our survey results indicate a distinct pattern in energy drink consumption across genders:  
• Male respondents demonstrate a notably higher engagement with energy drinks, with 6,038 individuals participating in relevant survey responses.  
• In contrast, female respondents account for 3,455 relevant survey responses.  
• For the Non-binary category, no responses were recorded in this dataset.  

This data suggests that energy drinks currently resonate more significantly with the male demographic. Understanding the underlying factors contributing to this difference could be valuable for refining marketing strategies and product positioning to potentially broaden appeal across all gender groups.

### b. Which age group prefers energy drinks more?

• Our analysis clearly shows that the 19-30 age group has the highest preference for energy drinks, with 5,520 responses. They are followed by the 31-45 age group (2,376 responses) and the 15-18 age group (1,488 responses).  
• As respondents get older, the preference for energy drinks appears to decrease significantly. The 46-65 age group shows considerably lower engagement (426 responses), while those 65 and above show the least preference, with only 190 responses.  
• This highlights a strong concentration of energy drink consumers within the younger adult demographic, particularly between 19 and 45 years old.

### c. Which type of marketing reaches the most Youth (15-30)?

• TV commercials come in as the second most impactful channel, reaching 1,785 individuals in this age group. Other channels like "Other" and "Outdoor billboards" have a similar reach (702 each), while "Print media" appears to be the least effective with 446.  
• This strongly suggests that digital platforms are key to connecting with the youth demographic, making online ad strategies crucial for future campaigns targeting this age segment.

## 5. Brand Penetration

### a. What do people think about our brand? (overall rating)
<img width="863" height="581" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c775538-3b48-4cc6-ab26-a2ba5b341fab" />


• Most people view the brand as neutral (5,974 mentions) — neutral responses far outnumber positive (2,257) and negative (1,769).

• Perceived effectiveness is the top general trait (2,909 mentions), so many think the product works.

• But a large group is undecided about the brand’s health impact — “Not sure” (2,610), nearly as big as those saying it’s effective.

• Health vs danger is split (~2,243 healthy vs ~2,238 dangerous), showing mixed beliefs about safety.

• Takeaway: convert the large neutral/unsure segment into positive buyers by boosting clarity on health benefits and targeted reputation-building.

### b. Which cities do we need to focus more on?
<img width="827" height="472" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a2b9b68-00b1-4094-96a9-0e6cb680ed1e" />
<img width="612" height="567" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cca0789-629e-4690-ad73-2b4a5ca6d175" />



• Mumbai (1,363 not tried) and Pune (866 not tried) stand out with the highest number of people who have never tried energy drinks, showing big untapped potential.

• Bangalore (844 not tried) and Hyderabad (562 not tried) also show large numbers of non-triers, despite being major metros.

• For rare consumption, Hyderabad (733) and Kolkata (225) lead, meaning even among those who tried, many rarely consume.

• Cities like Ahmedabad (289 not tried, 172 rarely consume) and Chennai (270 not tried, 171 rarely consume) show both trial and frequency challenges.

• Smaller cities like Lucknow and Jaipur have lower absolute counts, but still show meaningful opportunity relative to their respondent base.

• Takeaway: Focus marketing and awareness campaigns in Mumbai, Pune, Bangalore, and Hyderabad to convert the large non-trier segment, while also working on Hyderabad and Kolkata to increase frequency among existing users.

## 6. Purchase Behavior

### a. Where do respondents prefer to purchase energy drinks?
<img width="647" height="402" alt="Q6 a" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fb2dfa0-76aa-4db1-8445-67996a0a550a" />

• Online retailers represent the second most popular channel, with 2,550 respondents. Following these, Gyms and fitness centers (1,464), Local stores (813), and "Other" locations (679) also serve as purchase points.  
• This insight suggests that physical retail, especially supermarkets, remains the primary avenue for energy drink sales, with a significant and growing presence in the e-commerce space.

### b. What are the typical consumption situations for energy drinks among respondents?
<img width="847" height="408" alt="Q6 b" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5afb5df3-d940-427a-beb8-7c8e9532c8a4" />

• This clearly indicates that energy drinks are primarily associated with physical activity and periods requiring sustained focus or alertness.

### c. What factors influence respondents' purchase decisions, such as price range and limited edition packaging?
<img width="778" height="693" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb41aae5-e224-4855-8707-17cb94dd26c5" />



- **Price Range** strongly influences purchase:
  - Majority prefer the **₹50–99 range (4,288 respondents)**.  
  - The next popular range is **₹100–150 (3,142 respondents)**, followed by **Above ₹150 (1,561)**.  
  - Only **1,009 respondents** prefer **Below ₹50**, showing ultra-low price isn’t a key driver.  

- **Limited Edition Packaging** has a mixed but important influence:
  - **3,946 respondents said Yes** (packaging influences them).  
  - **4,023 respondents said No**, almost the same share.  
  - **2,031 respondents are Not Sure**, indicating undecided customers who could be swayed.  

📌 **Takeaway:** Price sensitivity is clear, with most customers clustering around ₹50–150.  
Limited edition packaging divides the audience — about half find it appealing, while half don’t — so packaging campaigns should be targeted at segments more likely to respond (e.g., youth or trend-conscious buyers).
