# Strategic Marketing Analysis (SQL)

This project focuses on analyzing survey data to uncover insights into consumer preferences, behaviors, and marketing effectiveness in the energy drink industry. 

We explored key demographics, brand perception, preferred ingredients and packaging, purchase behavior, and the impact of various marketing channels. Based on the findings, we provide strategic recommendations to help brands improve product development, regional focus, and campaign performance.


## 1. Demographic Insights
### a. Who prefers energy drink more? (male/female/non-binary?)
<img width="785" height="417" alt="Q1 a" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/561f499d-32f8-4e77-83d8-b370885375d1" />

Our survey results indicate a distinct pattern in energy drink consumption across genders:  
• Male respondents demonstrate a notably higher engagement with energy drinks, with 6,038 individuals participating in relevant survey responses.  
• In contrast, female respondents account for 3,455 relevant survey responses.  
• For the Non-binary category, no responses were recorded in this dataset.  

This data suggests that energy drinks currently resonate more significantly with the male demographic. Understanding the underlying factors contributing to this difference could be valuable for refining marketing strategies and product positioning to potentially broaden appeal across all gender groups.

### b. Which age group prefers energy drinks more?
<img width="787" height="497" alt="Q1 b" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c9fbf46-807e-4a1e-8fc9-ed1dd5c145a0" />

• Our analysis clearly shows that the 19-30 age group has the highest preference for energy drinks, with 5,520 responses. They are followed by the 31-45 age group (2,376 responses) and the 15-18 age group (1,488 responses).  
• As respondents get older, the preference for energy drinks appears to decrease significantly. The 46-65 age group shows considerably lower engagement (426 responses), while those 65 and above show the least preference, with only 190 responses.  
• This highlights a strong concentration of energy drink consumers within the younger adult demographic, particularly between 19 and 45 years old.

### c. Which type of marketing reaches the most Youth (15-30)?
<img width="925" height="516" alt="Q1 c" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ebfe5da-5ad0-4d3f-8154-6d8f4832c23c" />

• Our analysis reveals that online advertisements are by far the most effective marketing channel for reaching young people aged 15-30, with 3,373 recorded instances of engagement.  
• TV commercials come in as the second most impactful channel, reaching 1,785 individuals in this age group. Other channels like "Other" and "Outdoor billboards" have a similar reach (702 each), while "Print media" appears to be the least effective with 446.  
• This strongly suggests that digital platforms are key to connecting with the youth demographic, making online ad strategies crucial for future campaigns targeting this age segment.

### b. What are the primary reasons consumers prefer those brands over ours?
<img width="445" height="457" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2d70a8f-735e-47fb-ad74-1db5cce7d336" />

• Brand reputation (2,652 mentions) and taste/flavor (2,011) are the top reasons people choose other brands.

• Availability (1,910) and perceived effectiveness (1,748) also strongly drive competitor preference.

• Among those who haven’t tried our brand, health concerns (1,197) and not interested in energy drinks (1,179) are the biggest barriers.

• Not available locally (1,165) and unfamiliar with the brand (1,030) show distribution and awareness gaps we must fix.

• Quick takeaway: prioritize visibility and distribution (1,165–1,910 range) while addressing health messaging (≈1,200) and taste/reputation (≈2,000–2,650).

## 4. Marketing Channels and Brand Awareness

### a. Which marketing channel can be used to reach more customers?

• This indicates a strong preference and effectiveness of digital marketing and traditional television in reaching a wider audience for energy drink products.

### b. How effective are different marketing strategies and channels in reaching our customers?
<img width="1043" height="495" alt="Q4 b" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81dfa068-aa6b-42d5-971c-b52beaa1b7fa" />

## 5. Brand Penetration

### a. What do people think about our brand? (overall rating)
<img width="863" height="581" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c775538-3b48-4cc6-ab26-a2ba5b341fab" />


• Most people view the brand as neutral (5,974 mentions) — neutral responses far outnumber positive (2,257) and negative (1,769).

• Perceived effectiveness is the top general trait (2,909 mentions), so many think the product works.

• But a large group is undecided about the brand’s health impact — “Not sure” (2,610), nearly as big as those saying it’s effective.

• Health vs danger is split (~2,243 healthy vs ~2,238 dangerous), showing mixed beliefs about safety.

• Takeaway: convert the large neutral/unsure segment into positive buyers by boosting clarity on health benefits and targeted reputation-building.

### b. Which cities do we need to focus more on?
<img width="935" height="795" alt="Q5 b" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdc898a1-4aee-4a5a-8930-1ffc5a948bba" />

• Our analysis of consumption frequency reveals the cities where energy drink usage is comparatively lower, indicating areas for strategic focus.  
• Hyderabad stands out as the city where the highest number of respondents (733 out of 1,833) rarely consume energy drinks. This suggests a significant opportunity for growth and increased penetration. Kolkata (225 out of 566) and Ahmedabad (172 out of 456) also show a relatively high proportion of infrequent consumers.  
• Conversely, cities like Lucknow (21 out of 175), Jaipur (43 out of 360), and Delhi (78 out of 429) have a lower number of respondents who rarely consume energy drinks, suggesting potentially better existing penetration or different market dynamics.  
• To drive market growth, efforts should be intensified in cities like Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Ahmedabad to convert infrequent consumers into more regular users.

## 6. Purchase Behavior

### a. Where do respondents prefer to purchase energy drinks?
<img width="647" height="402" alt="Q6 a" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fb2dfa0-76aa-4db1-8445-67996a0a550a" />

• Our data clearly indicates that Supermarkets are the dominant choice for purchasing energy drinks, with 4,494 respondents making their purchases there.  
• Online retailers represent the second most popular channel, with 2,550 respondents. Following these, Gyms and fitness centers (1,464), Local stores (813), and "Other" locations (679) also serve as purchase points.  
• This insight suggests that physical retail, especially supermarkets, remains the primary avenue for energy drink sales, with a significant and growing presence in the e-commerce space.

### b. What are the typical consumption situations for energy drinks among respondents?
<img width="847" height="408" alt="Q6 b" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5afb5df3-d940-427a-beb8-7c8e9532c8a4" />

• Our analysis reveals that energy drinks are most frequently consumed during Sports/exercise, with a significant 4,494 mentions.  
• This is followed by Studying/working late, which accounts for 3,231 consumption instances. Social outings/parties also represent a notable consumption situation (1,487 mentions). Less common situations include Other (491) and Driving/commuting (297).  
• This clearly indicates that energy drinks are primarily associated with physical activity and periods requiring sustained focus or alertness.

### c. What factors influence respondents' purchase decisions, such as price range and limited edition packaging?
<img width="782" height="533" alt="Q6 c" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65827b14-c152-4572-b1bf-38b84ff646fe" />

• Our analysis concerning the impact of limited edition packaging reveals a nearly even split among respondents:  
  o 4,023 respondents indicated that limited edition packaging does 'No't influence their decision.  
  o Almost as many, 3,946 respondents, stated that 'Yes,' it does influence their purchase decisions.  
  o A notable 2,031 respondents were 'Not Sure' about its influence.  
• This close division suggests that while limited edition packaging is a significant motivator for a substantial portion of consumers, it is not universally influential. There's a considerable segment for whom it makes no difference, and another sizable group who are undecided. This indicates a nuanced role for such packaging in purchasing behavior.
